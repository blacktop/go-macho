# Capture Type Cleanup Summary

## Work Completed

### 1. Added Leading Underscore Normalization
**File**: `swift.go:3714-3722`

Added normalization in `makeSymbolicMangledNameWithDemangler` to strip leading `_` from type manglings before passing to the demangler. This fixes patterns like `_Sb` → `Sb` (Swift.Bool).

**Rationale**: Swift type manglings in binaries can have a leading underscore, but the demangler expects manglings without it. Symbol manglings use `_$s` but type manglings just use letters like `Sb`, `SS`, etc.

### 2. Minimized Legacy Fallback
**File**: `swift.go:3689-3712`

Restructured the fallback logic to:
1. Try the new demangler first (with resolver support)
2. Fall back to legacy only if demangler fails
3. Add clear logging when legacy is used (with `GO_MACHO_SWIFT_DEBUG`)
4. Return placeholder if both fail: `<undemangled type at ADDR: bytes>`

**Result**: Legacy fallback is still present but clearly marked and logged. This allows us to track which patterns still need parser improvements.

### 3. Regression Tests Added
**Files**:
- `swift_normalization_test.go` - Tests underscore normalization
- `swift_capture_types_test.go` - Tests real-world capture patterns

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Leading underscore stripping (`_Sb` → `Swift.Bool`)
- ✅ Simple types (`Sb`, `SS`, `Say`)
- ✅ Optional types (`SbSg` → `Swift.Bool?`)
- ✅ Impl function types (`pIegg_` → `<@escaping @callee_guaranteed ...>`)
- ✅ Symbolic references (with mock resolver)
- ⚠️  Optional + impl function combo (`pSgIegg_` - currently fails, documented)

### 4. External Reference Handling
**File**: `swift.go:2707-2760` (from previous work)

External references (dyld shared cache addresses like `0x186000001`) now return sensible placeholders: `<external@0xADDRESS>` instead of failing with "Error Swift ?".

## Integration Test Results

**Before**: 10 "Error Swift ?" occurrences in `lockdownmoded` binary
**After**: 2 "Error Swift ?" occurrences

**Example improvements**:
```
# Before:
block /* 0x10003a158 */ {
  /* capture types */
    Error Swift ?      ← FIXED
    Swift.Bool
    Swift.Bool
    _objc_release
    Swift.Bool
}

# After:
block /* 0x10003a158 */ {
  /* capture types */
    <external@0x186000001>  ← Clear placeholder
    Swift.Bool
    Swift.Bool
    _objc_release
    Swift.Bool
}
```

## Remaining Gaps

### Pattern: Compound Type with Symbolic Reference + Impl Function
**Addresses**: `0x10003a268`, `0x10003a304`
**Raw bytes**: `5362029d4500005f70536749656779675f`
**Breakdown**:
- `5362` = "Sb" (Swift.Bool)
- `029d450000` = Symbolic reference (resolves to `<external@0x186000001>`)
- `5f70536749656779675f` = `_pSgIegyg_` (impl function type)

**Current behavior**:
- Demangler parses "Sb" successfully
- Resolves symbolic reference successfully
- Encounters `_pSgIegyg_` as "trailing characters" and fails
- Falls back to legacy: "Swift.Bool Error Swift ?<@escaping @callee_guaranteed function>"

**Issue**: The parser treats the type as complete after "Bool + symbolic ref" and doesn't recognize that the impl function type signature is part of the same mangling. This likely requires parser-level changes to handle compound types correctly.

**Recommended fix**: Investigate how compound type manglings are structured in Swift ABI and update the parser to handle this pattern. The impl function type (`Iegyg_`) should be parsed as part of the overall type structure, not as trailing characters.

## Files Modified

1. **swift.go**:
   - `makeSymbolicMangledNameWithDemangler()` - Added normalization
   - `makeSymbolicMangledNameStringRef()` - Improved fallback logic with logging

2. **swift_normalization_test.go** (new):
   - Tests for underscore normalization
   - Tests for impl function type patterns

3. **swift_capture_types_test.go** (new):
   - Comprehensive capture type pattern tests
   - Symbolic reference tests with mock resolver
   - Documentation of expected behavior

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
$ go test ./internal/swiftdemangle ./pkg/swift ./
ok  	github.com/blacktop/go-macho/internal/swiftdemangle	(cached)
ok  	github.com/blacktop/go-macho/pkg/swift	(cached)
ok  	github.com/blacktop/go-macho	0.286s
```

## Next Steps

1. **Parser Enhancement**: Handle compound type + symbolic reference + impl function patterns (requires parser.go changes)

2. **Legacy Removal**: Once parser supports all patterns, remove `makeSymbolicMangledNameLegacy` entirely

3. **Dyld Shared Cache Integration**: For proper external type resolution instead of placeholders

4. **Monitor Legacy Fallback**: Use `GO_MACHO_SWIFT_DEBUG=1` to identify remaining patterns that fall back to legacy

## Usage

To see which types are falling back to legacy:
```bash
GO_MACHO_SWIFT_ENGINE=purego GO_MACHO_SWIFT_DEBUG=1 \
  go run ../ipsw/cmd/ipsw macho info binary --swift --swift-all --demangle 2>&1 | \
  grep "legacy fallback succeeded"
```
