/// If the \e new compiler can treat the new and old format identically, or if
/// the presence of a new record, block, or field is sufficient to indicate that
/// the swiftdoc file is using a new format, it is okay not to increment this

/// absence of information differently for the old and new formats; in this
/// case, the difference in minor version number can distinguish the two.
///
/// The minor version number does not need to be changed simply to track which
/// compiler generated a swiftdoc file; the full compiler version is already
/// stored as text and can be checked by running the \c strings command-line
/// tool on a swiftdoc file.
