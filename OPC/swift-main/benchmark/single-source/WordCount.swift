**Welcome to Swift!**

Swift is a high-performance system programming language.  It has a clean and
modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and
frameworks, and is memory safe by default.

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a
C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core
features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level
constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces
modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.

To learn more about the programming language, visit swift.org.

## Contributing to Swift

Contributions to Swift are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the
Contributing to Swift guide.

To be a truly great community, Swift.org needs to welcome developers from all
walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of
experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more
unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to
make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift has adopted the code
of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. This document is used across
many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values well. For
more, see the Code of Conduct.

## Getting Started

These instructions give the most direct path to a working Swift development
environment. To build from source you will need 2 GB of disk space for the
source code and over 20 GB of disk space for the build artifacts. A clean build
can take multiple hours, but incremental builds will finish much faster.
