# This is a simple implementation of an acyclic build graph. We require no
# cycles, so we just perform a reverse post order traversal to get a topological
# ordering. We check during the reverse post order traversal that we do not
# visit any node multiple times.
#
# Nodes are assumed to be a product's class.
